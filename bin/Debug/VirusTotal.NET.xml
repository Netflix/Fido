            <summary>
            Gets the report of the file represented by its hash or scan ID.
            Keep in mind that URLs sent using the API have the lowest scanning priority, depending on VirusTotal's load, it may take several hours before the file is scanned,
            so query the report at regular intervals until the result shows up and do not keep submitting the file over and over again.
